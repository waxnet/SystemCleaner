# <p align= "center">System Cleaner</p>

## Overview
This is a simple and lightweight system cleaner tool I made for fun in my free time. It performs basic system cleanup tasks such as clearing temporary files, flushing DNS cache, and running disk cleanup. The tool also creates a system restore point before making any changes to the system, ensuring the ability to revert in case of any issues.

## Usage
1. Download and unzip the project files.
2. Run `cleaner.cmd` as an administrator.
   - The script will automatically prompt for admin privileges if not already running as an administrator.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions and allow the cleaner to perform all tasks.
4. After the process is complete, the cleaner will generate a log in `data.txt` with the cleanup details.

## Requirements
- Windows operating system.
- Admin privileges are required for certain system operations, such as deleting system files and creating a restore point.
